# Boat-Dynamics
3DoF simulation of a boats movement in the ocean. Many assummptions where made, but an interesting project.

The simulation consists of a boat that is moving with the waves and wind. There is also possible to add a load with a mass on top of the boat to see how the load moves on top of the boat. Fences can be added to make sure the load dont fall over board. Results are shown below:

here you see the different phases for the boats angular movement and the loads positional movement.

Simulation where the boat tipped over.
